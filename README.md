# Stock Data Extraction and Visualization
The project scenario involved assuming the role of a Data Scientist tasked with analyzing stock price and revenue data for Tesla (TSLA) and GameStop (GME). I utilized several Python libraries, including Pandas, yfinance, requests, BeautifulSoup, and Plotly, to accomplish the following tasks: 

1. Extracted historical stock price data for TSLA and GME using the yfinance library.
2. Web scraped financial websites to obtain quarterly revenue data for both companies using BeautifulSoup.
3. Cleaned and formatted the extracted data, handling tasks such as removing unwanted characters and dealing with missing values.
4. Performed exploratory data analysis on the prepared datasets to identify patterns and trends.
5. Created interactive visualizations using Plotly to display the stock price and revenue data over time for each company.
